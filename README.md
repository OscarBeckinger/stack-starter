# stack-starter

`stack-starter` is a CLI tool designed to simplify the setup of full-stack projects. With `stack-starter`, you can quickly create a new full stack project with a specified template, which includes a basic project structure. Set up your frontend, server, and database all with one command! I am working on adding set up templates for MERN, MEAN, React w/ Firebase, and more!


## Installation

You can install `stack-starter` globally on your system with the following command (`stack-starter` is not on the npm registry yet, but will be soon!):

```bash
npm install -g stack-starter
```
or
```bash
yarn global add stack-starter
```

## Usage

### Create a New Project

To create a new project, use the `create` command with the `-n` (or `--name`) and `-t` (or `--template`) options:

```bash
stack-starter create -n <project-name> -t <template-name>
```
